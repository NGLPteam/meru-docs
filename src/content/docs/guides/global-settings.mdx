## Edit Global Settings

*Global settings apply to your entire Meru instance under your provider account. This is where you can update the site logo, configure controlled vocabularies, customize the theme, and manage global elements such as the footer.*

### Access Global Settings

<Steps>

1. Log in to the Meru Admin.
2. To get to the global settings, go to **Manage** in the main navigation and click on **Global settings**.

    <Badge text="Note" variant="note" /> _The global settings are only visible to users with `global_admin` privileges._


3. A drawer will open up with all of the global settings fields.
